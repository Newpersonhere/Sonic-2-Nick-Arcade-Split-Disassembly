# Sonic 2 Nick Arcade - Split Disassembly
This prototype was famous for being either very similar or being the exact prototype featured on the show called Nick Arcade (it's unverifiable), drx dumped the ROM and made it public on November 7th, 2006 and made a text/IDB disassembly on December 3rd of the same year.
This split disassembly is based off of this version, and it's up for [research purposes](https://tcrf.net/Proto:Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2_(Genesis)/Nick_Arcade_Prototype)!
It's currently not very complete, and I don't know when it'll be complete. ~~(and I'd rather not be stressed by a deadline, haha...)~~
# Note
I (RepellantMold and AlexField442) do not claim ownership of any of this code, it was all programmed by Yuji Naka @ SEGA Technical Institute back in 1992
